# Test Mark Prediction using Linear Regression
This project implements a basic machine learning model that utilizes linear regression to predict upcoming test marks based on the scores of the previous two tests. The model aims to estimate the performance of a student by analyzing their historical test results and establishing a linear relationship between the scores.


### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

• Python (version 3.6 or above)
• NumPy
• Pandas
• scikit-learn
